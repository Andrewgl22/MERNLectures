-API requests
-promises (Asynchronous requests)
-api request returned as readable byte stream, then needs to be 
converted to json
-useEffect

-grab data from API and store in component useEffect state
-2 buttons to cycle through API calls with string interpolation, 
illuminates the need for the dependency array

-axios
-axios makes the conversion from readableByteStream into json
so only fetch needs to then convert the result to json
