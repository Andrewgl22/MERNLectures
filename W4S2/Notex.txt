Week 4 Session 2

Intro to Node and Backend Setup

-install Postman
*Tom introduces Postman before getting into back-end routes. I would probably
wait to explain it until we had back-end routes.

-server.js file
-npm init to create package.json with dependencies
-install express

-configuring server with require(express) and const app = express
plus app.listen()

-npm init -y immediately creates your package.json
npm init will give you prompts to set it up, entry point 
should be server.js

-npm i nodemon

-middleware 
    -app.use(express.json())
    -app.use(express.urlencoded)

-faker api
