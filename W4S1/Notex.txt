Week 4 Session 1

-react-router
    -<BrowserRouter> wraps everything in the App.js return
    -<Route /> specifies a specific route and element= the component
        to be rendered
    -a tags refresh page and wipes out state, so Link tags from react-router are better
    -useNavigate - should be imported and stored in a variable
        navigate("/path") good for use in functions when clicking,

    -view component folder

    -useParams to grab value from URL.

    *Tom uses Countries API as example project, uses React-Bootstrap
